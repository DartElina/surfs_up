# Surfs Up
## Overview 
W. Avy wants to invest in a Surf and Ice Cream shop on Oahu. He's tried this before and it failed. So now he's doing the research first. He's collected some data, and he's ask us to filter the data to understand the weather on Oahu and see if it's condusive to surfing and ice cream consumption. 

## Results
The data shows the weather is between 56 and 85 degrees farenheit. We compared June and December descriptive statistics to learn about weather more deeply. The average is between 71 (December) and 75 (June), with a just a few degrees of variation. This means the weather is generally warm year round. This should be very agreeable for surfers who'd like ice cream as well! Below I have summarized the descriptive statistics in degrees Farenheit.

## Summary
In reviewing the initial analysis I decided to run an additional couple of queries to find the average rainfall daily, since surfers likely won't sirf or eat ice cream on rainy days. Like the temperature analysis I compared June and December to get an idea of the variation we may see throughout the year as the seasons change. Following I have displayed the descriptive statistics for rainfall in inches.
